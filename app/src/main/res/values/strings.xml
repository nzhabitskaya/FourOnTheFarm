The goal of the game is to connect four pumpkins/tomatoes horizontally, vertically or diagonally before your opponent can do that. Tap the garden bed in which you want to put your pumpkin/tomato, the vegetable will appear at the top and then fall down. The game has two modes: human vs computer (three difficulty levels) and human vs human. Have a nice game!</string>
    
    <string name="about_text">
        FourOnTheFarm is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of ones own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. To win the game, the player must connect only four pieces together. In some variations of the game, a connect five is what is known as a bust. Although the object is to be able to successfully connect four pieces, the player loses if they are unable to limit the gameboard to only connecting four pieces.
